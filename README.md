# up-api-google-sheets

Prototype for using the [Up Banking API](https://developer.up.com.au/) in Google Sheets.

> **NOTE:** The Up API is in beta release for personal use only. As such, this repo will not be published as an Addon.

## Installation

1. Create a new Google Sheet and select "Tools" → "Script Editor".
2. Paste in the contents of [`up.gs`](https://github.com/azz/up-api-google-sheets/blob/master/up.gs) into the code window.
3. Save the script as "Up API" and accept the authorization request (you may need to proceed through a security warning, as this is not a published Addon).
4. Reload your Google Sheet and select "Up API" → "Set Up...".
5. You should now see an "Up API" menu.
